# Swimtrack

SwimTrack is a full-stack web application designed to digitize and streamline the process of managing swimming progress worksheets. At many workplaces, like mine, hundreds of paper worksheets are stored away in filing cabinets. When someone requests progress updates, it requires a time-consuming search through these physical records.

To solve this inefficiency, I created SwimTrackâ€”a modern solution that organizes, stores, and makes progress tracking easily accessible. The application features a MongoDB database, a Node.js/Express backend, and a React frontend with a responsive interface.

With SwimTrack, staff can manage student progress effortlessly, saving time and reducing reliance on physical storage.

## Features
- Create and organize worksheets.
